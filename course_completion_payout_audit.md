# Audit Report: Course Completion Payout Feature (Issue #53)

This document presents the final audit of the smart contract changes implementing the automatic USDC reward payout upon course completion in the Learnault Protocol.

## 1. Feature Specifications & Implementation Status

| Specification / Requirement | Implementation Detail | Status |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Automatic Reward Trigger** | Inside `complete_module` in [lib.rs](file:///c:/Users/Bamsy/learnault-contracts/contracts/course-registry/src/lib.rs), when `new_progress == course.total_modules`, a cross-contract call is made to the `RewardPool` contract. | **Active & Verified** |
| **USDC Payout Amount** | The payout amount is configured as `10_0000000` (10 USDC, using the standard 7-decimal format for Stellar assets) in [lib.rs](file:///c:/Users/Bamsy/learnault-contracts/contracts/course-registry/src/lib.rs). | **Active & Verified** |
| **Access Control (Admin)** | Only the Protocol Admin can set or update the `RewardPool` contract address via `set_reward_pool_address` in [lib.rs](file:///c:/Users/Bamsy/learnault-contracts/contracts/course-registry/src/lib.rs). | **Active & Verified** |
| **Access Control (Spender)** | The `RewardPool` contract verifies that the calling `CourseRegistry` contract is whitelisted as an approved spender before executing the transfer. | **Active & Verified** |
| **Graceful Degradation** | If the `RewardPool` address is not configured, the module completion and badge minting still succeed without throwing an error. | **Active & Verified** |
| **Event Logging** | The `CourseCompleted` event is published, logging the learner, course ID, and payout amount on-chain. | **Active & Verified** |

## 2. Code Architecture Review

### A. State Storage Configuration
The configuration key is added to the `DataKey` enum in [types.rs](file:///c:/Users/Bamsy/learnault-contracts/contracts/course-registry/src/types.rs):
```rust
pub enum DataKey {
    Course(u32),
    Progress(Address, u32),
    CourseCount,
    Admin,
    BadgeNftAddress,
    RewardPoolAddress, // Storage key for RewardPool contract
}
```

### B. Trigger Implementation
The implementation is structured within the final module check block of `complete_module`:
```rust
if new_progress == course.total_modules {
    // Soulbound badge minting (if badge address is configured)...
    if let Some(badge_nft_address) = env
        .storage()
        .instance()
        .get::<DataKey, Address>(&DataKey::BadgeNftAddress)
    {
        let badge_nft = BadgeNFTClient::new(&env, &badge_nft_address);
        badge_nft.mint_badge(&env.current_contract_address(), &learner, &id);
    }

    // Trigger reward distribution if RewardPool address is configured
    if let Some(reward_pool_address) = env
        .storage()
        .instance()
        .get::<DataKey, Address>(&DataKey::RewardPoolAddress)
    {
        let reward_pool = RewardPoolClient::new(&env, &reward_pool_address);
        let base_reward: i128 = 10_0000000; // 10 USDC (7 decimal places)
        reward_pool.distribute_reward(
            &env.current_contract_address(),
            &learner,
            &base_reward,
        );

        CourseCompleted {
            learner: learner.clone(),
            course_id: id,
            reward_amount: base_reward,
        }
        .publish(&env);
    }
}
```

## 3. Security and Risk Analysis

* **Reentrancy Prevention**: The contract updates and saves the learner's progress in persistent storage (`DataKey::Progress`) **before** invoking external cross-contract calls. This adheres to the checks-effects-interactions pattern, mitigating potential reentrancy exploits.
* **Authorization Control**: The `RewardPool` contract performs a signature check (`caller.require_auth()`) on the calling contract and asserts its inclusion in the approved spenders list. Unwhitelisting the `CourseRegistry` correctly prevents any payouts.
* **Integrity of Call Parameters**: The transfer recipient is explicitly set to the verified `learner` address, and the caller is set to `env.current_contract_address()`, ensuring the correct contracts are debited and credited.

## 4. Testing & Verification

The test suite in [test.rs](file:///c:/Users/Bamsy/learnault-contracts/contracts/course-registry/src/test.rs) includes five dedicated scenarios:

1. **`test_complete_course_triggers_reward_distribution`**: Validates the complete happy path, verifying that both the badge and the 10 USDC reward are successfully distributed.
2. **`test_reward_not_distributed_without_whitelist`**: Confirms that if the `CourseRegistry` is not whitelisted in the `RewardPool`, the transaction reverts with `"Caller is not an authorized spender"`.
3. **`test_reward_not_distributed_if_reward_pool_not_set`**: Verifies that completion and badge minting succeed gracefully without throwing errors if the reward pool address is left unconfigured.
4. **`test_multiple_learners_get_independent_rewards`**: Confirms that multiple learners receive their independent payouts and the pool balance decrements correctly.
5. **`test_reward_distributed_only_on_final_module`**: Asserts that intermediate module completions do not trigger any reward distributions.

## 5. Conclusion
The automatic course completion payout feature has been successfully integrated, secured, and tested. The codebase meets all functional requirements and acceptance criteria.
